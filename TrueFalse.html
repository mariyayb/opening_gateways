        <div>
            <h1><center>True or False: How reliable are antibody test results?</center></h1>
        
        
        <p>Tests for COVID-19 antibodies have recently become available. An individual who takes such test will receive a positive or negative result. A positive result indicates that COVID-19 antibodies have been detected and so the individual has been exposed to the virus. A negative test indicates that antibodes have not been detected indicating that the individual has not been exposed to the virus. But it's not that simple. Diagnostic tests, including COVID-19 antibodies tests vary in their reliability. Two important numbers are:  </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>The <b>specificity</b> of a diagnostic test is a number that indicates: the chance that an individual who is truly negative will receive a negative test result.</li>
        
        <li>The <b>sensitivity</b> of a diagnostic test is a number that indicates: the chance that an individual who is truly positive will receive a positive test result.</li>
            
            
        </ul>
        
        
        
        <p>Ideally, when expressed as percentages, these numbers will be close to 100%.</p>
        
        <p>You might wonder: to find out the specificity, one has to know who is truly negative, and to find out the sensitivity, one has to know who is truly positive. Then what is the point of testing? The answer is that the numbers that are provided are just <i>estimates</i> (and can be quite good estimates).</p>
        

        <div>
        <h2>Reliability of test results</h2>
        You went in to for the test and your result is ready.
        <ul>
        <li> You test positive. How many people who test positive are really <i>negative</i>? These people have received a <b>false positive</b>.
        <li> You test negative. How many people who test negative are really <i>positive</i>? These people have received a <b>false negative</b>.
        </ul>
        <p>To estimate these numbers, it is also necessary to know the <i>proportion of the population being tested</i> with the disease.</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <div>
        <h2>Reliability calculator</h2>
        <p>Let the following numbers be expressed as proportions (taking values from 0 to 1):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\(p\) be the proportion of the population that is positive for antibodies.</li>
            <li>\(SP\) be the specificity of the test.</li>
            <li>\(SE\) be the sensitivity of the test.</li>
        </ul>
        
        From positive test results only, the proportion of individuals who are true negatives but receive a positive result is \(+True-\):
        \[+True- = \frac{p-p^2SE}{p-p^2SE +(1-p)^2SP}\]
        
        From negative test results only, the proportion of individuals who are true positives but receive a negative result is \(-True+\):
        \[-True+ = \frac{p-p^2SP}{p-p^2SP +(1-p)^2SE}\]

            3. A second equation can be obtained by differentiating both sides of equation (1)
             with respect to \(t\). We now have a system of two equations:
             \[𝑀⋅𝑥''(𝑡)+𝑘⋅𝑥(𝑡)=𝐹_{𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙}(𝑡)\]
             \[𝑀⋅𝑥'''(𝑡)+𝑘⋅𝑥'(𝑡)=𝐹'_{𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙}(𝑡)\]
             Recall that we are assuming \(x(t)\) and \(F(t)\) can be measured, so they are known. The unknowns are the parameters, \(M\) and \(k\). Solve this system of equations for \(M\) and \(k\).

             4. Assume a constant force of 1 Newton is applied to a spring-mass system. Suppose the displacement from equilibrium is given by \(x(t) = \sin{t} + \cos{t} + 1,\) where time is in seconds. Find \(M\) and \(k\) for this spring mass system. Work out the answer and show all of your work.
             
             5. Now assume a constant force of 1 Newton si applied to a spring-mass sytem. Suppose the displacement from equibirium is given by \(t^2 + 3*t + 1\), where time is in seconds.
              Find \(M\) and \(k\) for this spring mass system. You will see that your result cannot be valid. Think about why this happened and write down your thoughts.

             <h2>Extension: incorporating friction and air resistance</h2>
             <p>Equation (1) works in an idealized setting where there is not friction (in the case of a horizontal spring) or air resistance (in the case of a vertical spring). If friction or air resistance are present, they are proportional to the velocity of the mass. Recall that velocity is given by \(x'(t)\), the first derivative of displacement. Then the equation becomes:
             \[𝑀⋅𝑥''(𝑡)+c⋅x'(t)+𝑘⋅𝑥(𝑡)=𝐹_{𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙}(𝑡)\tag{2}\]

             2. Think about how you will come up with two additional equations to solve for the parameters. Write down the three equations.<br>
             3. Solve this system of equations for \(M\),\(c\), and \(k\).<br>
